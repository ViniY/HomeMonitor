# Jarvis at your service


<h3> Smartest Jarvis : </h3>
This is part of the project, everything we wanna do we have to press the button and look at the screens to get informed what is going on. \\
An new idea comes into my head when I go over Iron man AGAIN. \\
Why not have a Jarvis baby at home :D.\\
So here we are in this mini-project.\\

## Functionality
Ideally, it should be able to understand what you said, not only just recognize the word by word, but meanings, which I believe many people are trying to do the same thing in speech recognition, and they did a brilliant job. So in my prototype I will just keep it simple and use the developed packages.\\
