# A discord Bot


<h3> A Simple Discord bot: </h3>
I found dc bot is quite interesting recently, and I can actually customize a bot do what I want it to.<br ?>
So her is a new folder for it. This project can be also related to my HomeMonitor project, since the semanic analysis and feature selection for the NLP part gonna be extremly useful to let the monitor understand the users' commands.

## Objective
The bot donot have all the permission to manage the channel etc. so it only can reply to the users with specific commands. So, ideally it gonna be a chatting bot.

## Current Functionality ：
- Weather Report ：
    - The bot can fetch the weather report of the city user sent in the chat, and give a brief.
- Zanghua Bobi:
    - Jiu shi yong lai pen ren de
    - ke yi zi ding yi tian jia
    - lian jie shu ju ku cun chu
    - ke yi duo fa lian pen
- yin yang guai qi:
    - shi yong ge lei yin yang guai qi de hua yu tiao dou users
    - tong yang ke yi zi ding yi
    - tong yang lian jie database
- yin yang guai qi jin jie ban:
    - li yong ge da yin pin lai chao feng users
    - zi ding yi yin pin
- Music player
    - play the music by the url user sent in the chat.

## Later goal
The bot should be able to understand the words users sent, not only recognize the commands but can understand what we want it to do.
