# Jarvis at your service


<h3> Smartest Jarvis : </h3>
This is part of the project, everything we wanna do we have to press the button and look at the screens to get informed what is going on. <br />
An new idea comes into my head when I go over Iron man AGAIN. <br />
Why not have a Jarvis baby at home :D.<br />
So here we are in this mini-project.<br />

## Objective & or we say what I want it to do
Ideally, it should be able to understand what you said, not only just recognize the word by word, but meanings, which I believe many people are trying to do the same thing in speech recognition, and they did a brilliant job. So in my prototype I will just keep it simple and use the developed packages. <br />


## Current Functionality ：
- Weather Report ：
    - The mini Jarvis can fetch the weather information and read it out loud and clear
- Location Report:
    - Jarvis is capable of reporting the latitude and longtitude of the current location.
- Voice recognition
    - By the help of the packages, Jarvis is capable of recognizing the words we said and do work with its capable functionalities.

## Later goal
For sure it needs more functionalities, as I am developing the homemonitor, the programme get more inputs from surrounding like the tempreture, gas, light and so on, which means Jarvis can be able to know its surrounding environments better and tells the user what we gonna facing right now. And later on, we can let Jarvis to control the magic switches of light, air-conditioner, and so on, and be our perfect home controller? I guess this gonna need a long time later, but I will squeeze the time and keep myself on it. Peace.
