# Face Recongnition

## This module is used for Face Detection and Recognition. 

Currently, opencv is used for face detection, but however the performance of the model is not good enough. The face must be facing straight to the camera and no glasses , no hats, in one sentence it cannot handle complex situations, robustness is a must in such situation. 

DeepFace is also a handy packages but it has similar performance as opencv. 

## Goal

###1. Face Detection:
The model should be able to clearly extract faces from the Images. 
###2. Face Recognition:
The model should be able to tell if the person is living in the house or not. 
###3. The model need to be connected to DB and automatically save the info


## Worth a shot:
###1. Considering the background can affect the performance for object extraction, so planning to do a background substraction
###2.
